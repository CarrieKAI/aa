# Project Guide

## Preparation:
1. Download the project and open file Alogrithm in PyCharm
2. Add python interpreter to the project, the project is based on Python 3.6, please use the Pyhton 3.6 or higher version. 
3. Update pip ` $ pip install -U pip`
4. Install NetworkX with pip: `$ pip install networkx`
5. Install matplotlib with pip: `$ pip install matplotlib`

## Execute algorithm:
To test the greedy algorithm based on dijkstra:
step1. Open dijkstra/main.py, right click `Run main` to run the greedy algorithm based on Dijkstra algorithm.   
step2. Input graph data: Input node number and edge number at console to generate a graph automatically.  
step3. Input node pairs: Input node pairs at console to get the execution result.   

To test the greedy algorithm based on floyd:
 Open floyd/main.py, right click `Run main` to run the greedy algorithm based on Floyd algorithm. Do the same as the step2 and step3   
To test the ACO algorithm
 Open ACO/ACOalgorithm.py, right click `Run ACOalgorithm` to run the ACO algorithm.Do the same as the step2 and step3.
