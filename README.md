# Project Guide

## Preparation:
1. Download the project and open file Alogrithm in PyCharm
2. Add python interpreter to the project, the project is based on Python 3.6, please use the Pyhton 3.6 or higher version. 
3. Update pip ` $ pip install -U pip`
4. Install NetworkX with pip: `$ pip install networkx`
5. Install matplotlib with pip: `$ pip install matplotlib`

## Execute algorithm:
Execute dijkstra/main.py to run the greedy algorithm based on Dijkstra algorithm. Execute floyd/main.py to run the greedy algorithm based on Floyd algorithm. Execute ACO/ACOalgorithm.py to run the ACO algorithm.
2. Input graph data: Input node number and edge number at console to generate a graph automatically.
3. Input node pairs: Input node pairs at console to get the execution result.
